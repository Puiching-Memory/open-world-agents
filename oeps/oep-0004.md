Title: EnvPlugin Documentation Validation and Custom mkdocstrings Handler
Author: Open World Agents Team
Status: Final
Type: Standards Track
Requires: 3
Created: 08-Jun-2025
Post-History: 08-Jun-2025

Abstract
========

This OEP introduces a documentation validation system for EnvPlugins and a custom mkdocstrings handler for automatic documentation generation. The primary focus is on providing a `owl env validate-docs` command that can be used as a test utility for plugin quality assurance, with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration. Additionally, a minimal custom mkdocstrings handler enables automatic documentation generation from existing docstrings without manual maintenance.

Motivation
==========

The current OEP-3 plugin system lacks systematic documentation validation and automated documentation generation:

1. **No Documentation Quality Assurance**: There's no standardized way to validate that plugins have adequate documentation, making it difficult to maintain quality standards across the ecosystem
2. **Missing CI/CD Integration**: Plugin contributors need a test command that can validate documentation quality with proper exit codes for automated testing
3. **Manual Documentation Maintenance**: Plugin developers must manually maintain separate documentation files, leading to synchronization issues
4. **Limited mkdocstrings Integration**: While mkdocstrings works well for regular Python packages, it doesn't understand OWA's plugin structure and component organization

These limitations create barriers for both plugin quality assurance and documentation automation in CI/CD pipelines.

Rationale
=========

The design focuses on two key areas: documentation validation for quality assurance and minimal mkdocstrings integration:

**Documentation Validation as Testing**: The `owl env validate-docs` command serves as a test utility that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent documentation quality across all plugins with proper exit codes.

**Minimal mkdocstrings Handler**: A lightweight custom handler that understands OWA's plugin structure, enabling automatic documentation generation without complex infrastructure.

**CI/CD Integration**: Proper stdout/stderr output and exit codes make documentation validation part of the standard testing workflow for plugin contributions.

**Zero-Configuration Approach**: Both validation and documentation generation work out-of-the-box with existing plugin structures, requiring no additional configuration files or metadata.

Specification
=============

## Documentation Validation Command

### `owl env validate-docs` as Test Utility

The primary feature is a validation command that can be used as a test in CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Basic validation with quality grades
$ owl env validate-docs
‚úÖ std plugin: 2/2 documented (100%), 2/2 good quality (100%)
‚ö†Ô∏è  example plugin: 7/7 documented (100%), 3/7 good quality (43%)
‚ö†Ô∏è  desktop plugin: 20/25 documented (80%), 12/25 good quality (48%)
‚ùå custom plugin: 1/5 documented (20%), 0/5 good quality (0%)

üìä Overall: Minimum plugin coverage: 20% (custom), Minimum plugin quality: 0% (custom)
‚ùå FAIL: Some plugins below quality thresholds (PASS: 80%/60%, FAIL: 60%/0%)
$ echo $?
1

# Validation for specific plugin
$ owl env validate-docs example
‚ö†Ô∏è  example plugin: 7/7 documented (100%), 3/7 good quality (43%)
‚ùå FAIL: Minimum plugin quality 43% (example) below threshold (60%)
$ echo $?
1

# Quality-focused validation with custom thresholds
$ owl env validate-docs --min-quality-pass 0.7 --min-quality-fail 0.5
‚úÖ std plugin: 2/2 documented (100%), 2/2 good quality (100%)
‚ö†Ô∏è  example plugin: 7/7 documented (100%), 3/7 good quality (43%)
‚ùå FAIL: Some plugins below quality thresholds (PASS: 80%/70%, FAIL: 60%/50%)
$ echo $?
1

# Strict mode for CI/CD (enforces 100% coverage + 100% quality)
$ owl env validate-docs --strict
‚ùå FAIL: Minimum plugin quality 43% (example) below threshold (100%)
$ echo $?
1

# Custom coverage thresholds
$ owl env validate-docs --min-coverage-pass 0.9 --min-coverage-fail 0.7
‚ùå FAIL: Minimum plugin coverage 80% (desktop) below threshold (90%)
$ echo $?
1

# JSON output for tooling integration
$ owl env validate-docs --format json
{
  "min_plugin_coverage": 0.20,
  "min_plugin_quality": 0.0,
  "worst_coverage_plugin": "custom",
  "worst_quality_plugin": "custom",
  "thresholds": {
    "min_coverage_pass": 0.8,
    "min_quality_pass": 0.6
  },
  "plugins": {
    "std": {
      "documented": 2, "total": 2, "coverage": 1.0,
      "good_quality": 2, "quality_ratio": 1.0, "skipped": 0,
      "status": "pass", "issues": []
    },
    "example": {
      "documented": 7, "total": 7, "coverage": 1.0,
      "good_quality": 3, "quality_ratio": 0.43, "skipped": 0,
      "status": "warning", "issues": []
    },
    "desktop": {
      "documented": 20, "total": 25, "coverage": 0.8,
      "good_quality": 12, "quality_ratio": 0.48, "skipped": 0,
      "status": "warning", "issues": []
    },
    "custom": {
      "documented": 1, "total": 5, "coverage": 0.2,
      "good_quality": 0, "quality_ratio": 0.0, "skipped": 0,
      "status": "fail", "issues": ["custom/component1: Missing docstring"]
    }
  },
  "exit_code": 1
}
```

### Exit Code Specification

The command follows standard Unix conventions for test utilities:

- **Exit Code 0**: All validations passed
- **Exit Code 1**: Documentation issues found (warnings or failures)
- **Exit Code 2**: Command error (invalid arguments, plugin not found, etc.)

### Validation Criteria

#### Component-Level Quality Grades

**GOOD** ‚úÖ (High quality documentation)
- Has non-empty docstring
- Has examples AND type hints AND comprehensive description (>50 characters)
- Meets basic quality standards

**ACCEPTABLE** üìù (Basic documentation)
- Has non-empty docstring
- Missing examples, type hints, or comprehensive description
- Still counts as "documented" but lower quality

**POOR** ‚ùå (No documentation)
- No docstring or empty docstring
- Component is considered "undocumented"

#### Per-Plugin Quality Thresholds

**PASS** ‚úÖ (Plugin is well-documented)
- ‚â• 80% of components are GOOD or ACCEPTABLE
- ‚â• 60% of components are GOOD (high quality)

**WARN** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Plugin needs improvement)
- 60-79% of components are documented (GOOD or ACCEPTABLE)
- OR < 60% of components are GOOD quality

**FAIL** ‚ùå (Plugin is poorly documented)
- < 60% of components are documented

#### Skip Quality Check Feature

Components can opt out of quality checks using docstring comments:

```python
def legacy_function():
    """Legacy function with minimal docs.

    @skip-quality-check: legacy-code
    """
    pass

class InternalClass:
    """Internal implementation class.

    @skip-quality-check: internal-api
    """
    pass
```

**Valid skip reasons**: `legacy-code`, `internal-api`, `experimental`, `deprecated`, `third-party`

**Note**: Skipped components are excluded from quality calculations entirely.

**Note**: Detailed validation logic is implemented in the codebase at `projects/owa-core/owa/core/documentation/validator.py`.

## Custom mkdocstrings Handler

### Minimal Handler Implementation

A lightweight custom mkdocstrings handler that understands OWA plugin structure:

**Implementation Note**: The handler includes graceful degradation when mkdocstrings is not available, ensuring the core functionality remains intact even in minimal environments.

**Note**: The mkdocstrings handler is implemented as a separate package `mkdocstrings-owa` available on PyPI, not in this codebase.

### Usage in Documentation

The handler enables automatic documentation generation using familiar mkdocstrings syntax:

```markdown
# Plugin overview
::: example
    handler: owa

# Individual component
::: example/mouse.click
    handler: owa
    options:
      show_signature: true
      show_examples: true
```

### Integration Setup

**Note**: The OWA mkdocstrings handler is distributed as the `mkdocstrings-owa` package on PyPI and is automatically available when installed.

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml - Configure the handler
plugins:
  - mkdocstrings:
      handlers:
        owa:
          options:
            show_plugin_metadata: true
            include_source_links: true
```

**Note**: The OWA handler is distributed as the `mkdocstrings-owa` package and is automatically available when installed via pip. It integrates seamlessly with the existing mkdocstrings workflow.

## CI/CD Integration

### Using as Test Command

The validation command integrates seamlessly into testing workflows:

```bash
# In CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- name: Validate Plugin Documentation
  run: |
    owl env validate-docs --strict
    
# In pre-commit hooks
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: validate-docs
      name: Validate EnvPlugin Documentation
      entry: owl env validate-docs
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false

# In pytest integration
def test_plugin_documentation():
    """Test that all plugins have adequate documentation."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["owl", "env", "validate-docs", "--format", "json"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )

    data = json.loads(result.stdout)
    assert data["min_plugin_coverage"] >= 0.9, f"Minimum plugin coverage {data['min_plugin_coverage']} below 90%"
    assert result.returncode == 0, "Documentation validation failed"
```

**Note**: A working GitHub Actions workflow is implemented in `.github/workflows/validate-docs.yml` that demonstrates the CI/CD integration.

### Repository-wide Application

Apply validation across the entire repository:

```bash
# Validate all existing plugins
$ owl env validate-docs --strict
‚úÖ std plugin: 2/2 documented (100%), 2/2 good quality (100%)
‚úÖ example plugin: 7/7 documented (100%), 7/7 good quality (100%)
‚úÖ desktop plugin: 25/25 documented (100%), 25/25 good quality (100%)
‚ö†Ô∏è  gst plugin: 3/4 documented (75%), 3/4 good quality (75%)

üìä Overall: Minimum plugin coverage: 75% (gst), Minimum plugin quality: 75% (gst)
‚ùå FAIL: Minimum plugin coverage 75% (gst) below threshold (100%)

# Generate validation report
$ owl env validate-docs --format json > docs-validation-report.json
```

Implementation
=============

The implementation focuses on two key areas: documentation validation for CI/CD integration and minimal mkdocstrings support.

**Note**: Detailed implementation code is maintained in the codebase. This section provides architectural overview only.

### Minimal mkdocstrings Handler

**Note**: The mkdocstrings handler is implemented as the separate `mkdocstrings-owa` package available on PyPI.

**Core Components:**
- `projects/owa-core/owa/core/documentation/validator.py` - Documentation validation engine
- `mkdocstrings-owa` (external package) - Custom mkdocstrings handler for OWA plugins
- `projects/owa-cli/owa/cli/env/docs.py` - CLI commands with validation support

**Validation Features:**
- Exit code compliance for CI/CD integration (0=pass, 1=fail, 2=error)
- JSON output format for tooling integration
- Configurable coverage thresholds and quality checks
- Repository-wide validation support

**mkdocstrings Integration:**
- Lightweight custom handler for OWA plugin structure (via `mkdocstrings-owa` package)
- Automatic discovery through PyPI package installation
- Familiar mkdocstrings syntax and workflow
- Zero-configuration setup for existing plugins

Rejected Ideas
==============

### Complex Documentation Generation System

A comprehensive documentation generation system similar to Sphinx was considered but rejected because:
- Adds significant complexity and maintenance overhead
- Conflicts with the minimal, performant approach requested
- mkdocstrings already provides excellent documentation generation
- Focus should be on validation and minimal integration, not reinventing documentation tools

### Runtime Documentation Validation

Validating documentation at plugin load time was considered but rejected because:
- Would impact the performance benefits of OEP-3's lazy loading
- Unnecessary overhead for users who don't need documentation validation
- Conflicts with the on-demand principle of the plugin system
- Documentation validation should be a development/CI tool, not a runtime feature

### Comprehensive Template System

A full template system with extensive customization options was considered but rejected because:
- Adds complexity without clear benefit for the minimal use case
- mkdocstrings already provides excellent templating capabilities
- Focus should be on integration, not reimplementing existing functionality
- Simple templates are sufficient for the basic handler needs

Open Issues
===========

While the core specification is complete, several areas warrant further discussion:

### Documentation Quality Standards

- Should there be minimum documentation requirements for plugins?
- How should documentation quality be measured and enforced?
- What guidelines should be provided for effective plugin documentation?

### Integration with Package Managers

- Should documentation validation be integrated with PyPI package publishing?
- How should documentation versioning align with package versioning?
- What opportunities exist for documentation-based package discovery?
